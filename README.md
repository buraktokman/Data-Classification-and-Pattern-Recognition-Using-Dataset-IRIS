### Introduction:
------
Iris is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature.

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis.

Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.

In this project we are going to use Iris Dataset with 6 different machine learning algorithms and visualize the data and compare the results. Algorithms are listed below:

 - Logistic Regression **(LR)**
 - Linear Discriminant Analysis **(LDA)**
 - K-Nearest Neighbors **(KNN)**
 - Classification and Regression Trees **(CART)**
 - Gaussian Naive Bayes **(NB)**
 - Support Vector Machines **(SVM)**
